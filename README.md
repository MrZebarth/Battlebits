Battleship for the Microbit

Welcome to Battlebits! The 2 player Battleship clone for the BBC Micro:Bit.

Installation:
Download the hex file onto each Micro:Bit. That's it!

Instructions for Gameplay:
<ul>
<li><u>Pairing:</u> Select a radio frequency from 0-255. A button adds 10. B button adds 1. Shake to confirm. If there is another Micro:bit on the same frequency, you will pair up!
<li><u>Ship Placement:</u> Place 5 ships. Use A to move vertically, B to move horizontally. Shake to lock in your boat. Once both players have locked in 5 ships, it's game time!
<li><u>Attack Mode:</u> Select a location to fire upon. A moves vertically, B moves horizontally. Shake to fire. You can only fire on each space once. Previously fired shots will show up as solid LEDs. You will get an instant "Hit" or "Miss" message and the number of boats you've sunk.
<li><u>Defence Mode:</u> You just wait until the opponent is finished. You'll receive a "Hit" or "Miss" message so you'll know what how well they did.
<li><u>End Game:</u> First person to 5 hits wins the game! Use the reset button to start again.
